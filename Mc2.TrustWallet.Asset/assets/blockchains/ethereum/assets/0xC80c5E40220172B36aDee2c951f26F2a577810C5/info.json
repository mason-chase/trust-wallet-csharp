  "description": "Bankera is an operational fork of SpectroCoin. As SpectroCoin to be competitive has developed bank-like infrastructure, but was not intended to become a proper bank, it is releasing Bankera to leverage its regulatory and IT infrastructure to develop a bank for the blockchain era. Bankera as a proper bank will offer payments, investments, and loan and deposit solutions. Later on, it is planing to develop new types of money, such as inflation linked baskets.",
